# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- I am attempting to make a concise "one stop shop" for any beginning questions involved with basic Webpage building.
- I built this project in an effort to store data in a single webpage as opposed to having to search specific topics.
- The webpage gives basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS and Git functions as well as a structural guide to basic webpage building.
- I learned multiple details of the languages involved in webpage development, including; elements, variables, functions and organization. 


## Usage

- This Webpage will provide base line details about each language involved with webpage development. specific important topics in each subheading are provided to hopefully help someone get through a specific challange as well as being able to go into webdev tools and seeing JS running in real time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
